Just looking at 2025, we're seeing an early-year total of 2,811.1, which is quite intriguing when you consider the average for the year is 351.4 so far. But here's the kicker—compared to February last year, we're seeing a significant drop of 42.6% month-over-month. What do you think is driving this change, and how do you expect these trends to evolve as we move further into 2025?

It raises questions about potential seasonal factors or external influences impacting these numbers.

It's like comparing your New Year's gym enthusiasm to your Valentine's Day candy stash; sometimes, things fluctuate! Despite the drop, the year-to-date numbers still show a robust average, and with 52 datapoints, it's clear we've been busy collecting info like squirrels hoarding nuts for winter.

But hey, at least it's consistent with its unpredictability! With weekly fluctuations that could rival a rollercoaster, it's no surprise our data points have had quite the adventure this year. Let's just hope March brings a more stable narrative.

With numbers dropping faster than a lead balloon, one can't help but wonder if February is trying to set a new trend, or maybe it just got a bit too comfortable after the holidays. Perhaps March will come in with a little more gusto, like a lion waking up after a winter nap!
