# --- LangGraph Studio hook (local UI) ---
try:

Got it 👍
Here’s a clean Excel-style table content you can directly copy into Excel/Google Sheets to track all updates from agent1.py till your current podcast_fixed_openings.py and graph.py.

👉 This gives you a chronological update tracker (what changed, dependencies, what artifacts came out).
You can also add columns like “Owner” or “Date Updated” if you want more detail.

Do you want me to also add a “Status” column (✅ Completed / 🚧 In Progress / ⏳ Next Step) so you and your manager can quickly see where each phase stands?
