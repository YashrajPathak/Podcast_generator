üëâ This gives you a chronological update tracker (what changed, dependencies, what artifacts came out).
You can also add columns like ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù or ‚ÄúDate Updated‚Äù if you want more detail.

Do you want me to also add a ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù column (‚úÖ Completed / üöß In Progress / ‚è≥ Next Step) so you and your manager can quickly see where each phase stands?
