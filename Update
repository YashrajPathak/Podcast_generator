NEXUS: Welcome, Agents Reco and Stat, to an insightful exploration of our latest metrics trends. Notably, the Average Speed of Answer (ASA) saw a dramatic spikefrom 4,569 seconds in August 2024 to an astonishing 7,406 seconds by December 2024, before plummeting to 697 seconds in January 2025. Additionally, while the

STAT: Reco, statistically speaking, the data implies that the dramatic asa drop from 7,406.0 to 697.0 seconds is atypical; confirm timestamp alignment and run  
an iqr anomaly band check before concluding on noise versus genuine shifts.
